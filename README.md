This week, I was making a game to control a ball to reach a gate to another level. In every stage, you can use left, right arrows and gravity to control a ball and try to find the gate.   The block is where you can land, but some are shifting when the ball hits them. Some of them are "fake" blocks, so they can't support the ball's landing. So be aware of your route and try to find the gate. Now I have two scenes controlled by GameManager and will add more invisible gates to add more fun. Inspiration comes from paintings of Mondrian.
